<h1>Backend For The E-Commerce Project</h1>

<p>This project will serve as a backend for the E-Commerce Project we did. It will be responsible for storing user related data: Usernames, passwords, Credit Card Numbers, Addresses, (Possibly a purchase history), and orders placed/out for delivery.  This database will also store the products currently in stock and their price to compensate for any price changes.</p>
